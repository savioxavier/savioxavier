## âœ¨ This file serves as a guide to the main [README.md](./README.md) of my profile

Why you ask? Well, I'm not really sure, but I wanted a place to help any users curious enough to understand stuff that's in my README, like what purpose each section serves, where I got my data and images from and so on. Think of this as a guide to help you understand and find resources to help you make your own READMEs.

Yes, I'm aware this is unconventional and uncommon and this might as well be the first README guide you have ever seen, but here's some info for you to get started:

---

### Section: [Stuff I've Worked On](https://github.com/savioxavier/savioxavier#stuff-ive-worked-on)

- This section is about stuff I have worked on/contributed to in the past. I've listed just a few of my projects and past contributions, and might be subject to change.

---

### Section: [Stuff I'm Currently Working On](https://github.com/savioxavier/savioxavier#stuff-im-currently-working-on)

- This section is about the things I'm developing right now/usually develop. It also serves as a place to list the languages and framework I'm currently developing to expand my skillset.

---

### Section: [My Tech Stack](https://github.com/savioxavier/savioxavier#my-tech-stack)

- The section is about my tech stack and includes "badges" for each language/framework I've used

- All the badges in this section have been created using [shields.io](https://shields.io), with the style `for-the-badge`, along with custom foreground and background colors

- This sections includes three parts:

  - **Languages**: List of main programming languages I'm fluent in and those I use on a daily basis
  - **Frameworks, libraries and other tools**: List of frameworks and libraries in different languages I have used in the past for my projects

---

### Section: [Stuff I Use To Code](https://github.com/savioxavier/savioxavier#stuff-i-use-to-code)

- This section includes _some_ of the tools I use to code, like IDEs, text editors, source control and other related development tools

---

### Section: [Misc](https://github.com/savioxavier/savioxavier#misc)

- This section includes miscellaneous information, including my social and contact links as well topics and hobbies that I'm interested in

---

### Section: [Some Stats](https://github.com/savioxavier/savioxavier#some-stats)

- This section includes auto-generated statistics pertaining to my GitHub repositories and contributions. They have been generated with the help of [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

- These stat cards include information like the number of stars earned, total commit count in the past year, total pull request count, total issue count, project contribution count and of course, the language breakdown

- The cards have been generated using the [github-readme-stats API](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app) have a theme of `vue-dark`, with a hidden border of border radius of 10. The language breakdown card uses a API route of `top-langs`. More information can be found at [github-readme-stats's repository](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

### Section: [Some Popular Repos](https://github.com/savioxavier/savioxavier#some-popular-repos)

- This "hidden" section includes repo cards (generated by [github-readme-stats extra pins feature](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats#github-extra-pins))

- The cards have been generated using the [github-readme-stats API](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app) have a theme of `vue-dark`, with a hidden border of border radius of 10, similar to the GitHub stats and Top Languages card above

- This section is collapsible (with the help of `<details>` and `<summary>` tags)

---

### Section: [Support](https://github.com/savioxavier/savioxavier#support)

- This section consists of a [Buy Me a Coffee link](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/savioxavier) which serves as a primary donation link

- The Buy Me a Coffee button is generated using their CDN, with the Default Blue theme: [`https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-blue.png`](https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-blue.png)

That's about it, honestly. I really dunno why I decided to create this, but thanks a lot for reading and I hope it helps you out
